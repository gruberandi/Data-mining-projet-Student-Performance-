# Project description 

Overview

This project focuses on applying data mining techniques to analyze a dataset. The process involves multiple stages, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling. Below is a detailed explanation of the components and methods used in the project.

# Project Structure

1. Data Loading
The dataset is loaded using the pandas library from an Excel file. This step includes:
Reading the data into a DataFrame.
Removing duplicate rows to ensure data quality.

2. Data Cleaning
To handle missing or incomplete data:
Missing values are identified using isnull().sum().
Strategies to handle missing data, such as imputation or removal, are considered based on the extent of missingness.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the data's structure and key patterns. This includes:
Statistical summaries to identify mean, median
Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn for distributions, correlations, and outliers.

4. Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for modeling:
Data normalization and scaling are applied using StandardScaler.
Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) are used to simplify the dataset while retaining important information.

5. Clustering Analysis
K-Means clustering is applied to group similar data points. This involves:
Selecting the optimal number of clusters.
Visualizing the clustering results.

6. Results and Insights

The outcomes from the clustering and EDA steps are summarized to provide actionable insights into the dataset.
Requirements
To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn

Install these packages using:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


How to Run

1.Clone this repository.
2.Place the dataset in the specified path or update the code to reflect the dataset location.
3.Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute each step of the analysis.
